0	Continued Greenland ice loss	2012	2017	1	1	If fully melted, the Greenland ice sheet would raise global sea level by about 24 feet. Scientists agree that human-induced climate change is accelerating Greenland ice loss, which carries major implications for coastal regions across the world. Still, a complex array of feedback systems that contribute to ice loss remain poorly understood, making it difficult to accurately predict future melt rates. Based on analyses of satellite data and direct observations, scientists estimate that nearly 4000 billion metric tons of ice have been lost from Greenland since 2002 – almost enough to fill Lake Michigan – but the rate of ice loss could increase dramatically if we don’t take action to fight climate change. 	If fully melted, the Greenland ice sheet would raise global sea level by about 24 feet.
1	Contemporary Inuit Art	2000	2011	1	1	Recent drawings and prints by Inuit artists reflect a broad spectrum of themes, sometimes retaining elements of traditional subject matter or mythology, while also reflecting the challenges faced by a community whose way of life has been radically altered over just a few generations. Later work by the celebrated printmaker Kananginak Pootoogook (1935-2010) reflected the artist’s memories of camping and hunting scenes, while the work of his niece Shuvinai Ashoona (1961–) depicts life in the permanent settlement of Cape Dorset: scenes touch by both fantasy and alienation. These bodies of work feel deeply personal, offering rare glances into a society that can be traced back over a thousand years.

2	Initiation of GISP2 Ice Core Drilling	1988	1993	0	0.00	The second Greenland Ice Sheet Project (GISP2) ice core, shown in 88 Cores, is a highly accurate climate record that is nearly continuous for 110,000 years. Like rings of a tree, each layer of an ice core corresponds to a different year in Earth’s history. Scientists can analyze ice properties like grain size and gas concentration to explore past climate conditions including air temperature, pollution, and rate of snowfall. Drilling in central Greenland for GISP2 (the Greenland Ice Sheet) was initiated in 1988 and was completed five years later in 1993, funded by the U.S. National Science Foundation.

2	Reaching the North pole	1909	1914	-34.27	-0.021	Relying heavily on Inuit guides, American explorers Frederick Cook and Robert E. Peary raced to reach the North Pole in the early twentieth century. Both emerged in 1909–within several days of each other–to declare success. Their claims are disputed, as neither produced sufficient evidence to verify his location at precisely 90˚N. To this day, the first person to stand at the North Pole remains unclear. Any attempt to reach the North Pole is impeded by the fact that, unlike the South Pole, no landmass lies over it. Instead, the North Pole is located on drifting sea ice, constantly in motion. Despite our cultural fascination with it, the North Pole can be understood in essence as a fabrication of geometry. As one nineteenth century explorer wrote, “the pole was ascertained to be the intersection of lines in a point, of which nothing was to be seen in reality.”	Relying heavily on Inuit guides, American explorers Frederick Cook and Robert E. Peary raced to reach the North Pole in the early twentieth century.
0	Widespread Greenland ice melt event	1889	1894	-40.53	-0.025	By studying the layers of a Greenland ice core, scientists determined that the Greenland ice sheet experienced an extreme amount of surface melting in 1889. They identified a layer in the core from that year with nearly bubble-free ice – a signature of snow that melted and has later refrozen. In addition, they found evidence for a possible cause of the melt event: a high concentration of black carbon, which decreases the reflectivity of ice and was probably the result of forest fires raging across Europe at the time. Similar conditions were identified in ice core layers from 2012, the worst melt year on record. Climate change is known to increase the frequency of both warm weather and forest fires, which contributed to these melt events.

1	Landscape painting	1850	1885	-50	-0.031	In the 1800s, U.S. painters were defining the role of landscape as an integral part of the country’s national identity. Painters like Thomas Cole and Frederic Edwin Church of the Hudson Valley School depicted natural scenery with awe and religious conviction, in some sense championing the environmental movement. In 1859, Church embarked on an expedition to the North Atlantic to sketch icebergs; the resulting paintings, first shown in 1861, are highly dramatic and reflect the sense of wonder – perhaps even fear – experienced by Church as he explored these glaciated seascapes.

1	Frankenstein is published	1818	1823	-62.42	-0.039	Mary Shelley wrote the first science fiction novel, Frankenstein, or The Modern Prometheus, as a result of a ghost story-writing competition amongst her and her literary friends. Fascinated with popular science at the time, Shelley crafted the now-classic cautionary tale of the radical scientist Victor Frankenstein who bends the laws of nature to create his monster through electric reanimation. The Arctic landscape serves here as a mysterious and merciless backdrop to Victor’s story where both the creator and his creation meet their demise. Frankenstein defined a new genre of writing that is so popular today - one in which authors can play out the hypotheses of scientific speculation to the benefit or detriment of humankind. 	The Arctic landscape serves as a mysterious and merciless backdrop to Victor’s story where both the creator and his creation meet their demise.
2	Inuit wooden maps	1800	1816	-67	-0.042	These tactile, wooden maps were carved by an Inuit man named Kunit, who sold them to the Danish explorer Gustav Holm in the late 1800s. Very few of these maps exist today, yet they are a fascinating example of indigenous design that is both functional and beautiful. The maps can be used to navigate coastal routes near Kunit’s homeland in southeast Greenland, and they float if dropped in water. The wooden maps are a unique cultural object reflective of the Inuit people’s mastery of navigation and boating.

2	Search for the Northwest Passage	1650	1800	-100	-0.062	Particularly influential in the European imagination of the Arctic was the theory of an ice-free polar sea. By the middle of the nineteenth century, the ancient Greek myth of Hyperborea–describing a warm, polar ocean with no ice and eternal sunlight– had reconstructed itself as the scientific hypothesis of the Northwest Passage. Faith in the existence of the Passage was driven in large part by an appetite for a commercially lucrative trade route between Western Europe and Asia; the desire to discover it inspired much of early European exploration of coastal North America. More recently, rising temperatures and vanishing polar sea ice suggest that new trade routes will begin to open up across the Arctic, belatedly fulfilling the promise of the Northwest Passage.

0	Little Ice Age	1500	1650	-178	-0.11	The Little Ice Age was a period of widespread cooling that permeated the fabric of culture and society in Europe and North America. While its causes are still unclear, its devastating effects are well-documented, having resulted in shorter crop seasons, frequent food shortages, and famine. In Northern Europe, rapid glacial advance destroyed entire villages. Locally, the deeply frozen Hudson River enabled ‘commuting by sleigh’. Writers and artists responded to the Little Ice Age with an explosion of work depicting winter scenes, which were generally romanticized and did not depict the hardships of the lower class.

2	Pytheas reaches Far North	-330	0	-535	-0.33	Around 330 BCE, the Greek geographer Pytheas embarked on a voyage that would take him to the Arctic Circle – nearly 2000 miles from his home in Marseille. Pytheas was the first to describe Arctic phenomena like the midnight sun, the aurora, and floating sea ice in writing, and he used novel measurement tools to precisely record latitude and tidal variability. Pytheas named the landmass he reached (likely present-day Iceland or Norway) ‘Thule,’ meaning the land beyond all known lands. His momentous volume, On the Ocean, remained the only first-hand account of its kind for centuries, widely referred to by scholars in ancient Greece as a feat of science and exploration, but which has now been lost.	Pytheas was the first to describe Arctic phenomena like the midnight sun, the aurora, and floating sea ice in writing.
1	Greek depiction of Hyperborea	-440	-340	-556.48	-0.35	The Ancient Greeks developed a profound understanding of the natural world through astronomy, mathematics, and exploration, yet the “Far North” remained just out of reach, made inaccessible by frigid air and a turbulent ocean. Appearing first in myth and later in texts by Herodotus, a 5th century BCE historian, the Greeks believed that the lost continent of “Hyperborea” lay beyond the North Wind. Hyperborea, a place free of war and illuminated by eternal sunlight, is perhaps the first example of the western world’s fascination with the Arctic as a place of strange, other-worldliness – a portal to the unknown. The legend resurfaced in later European cultures, as shown by a 16th century map depicting Hyperborea by famed cartographer Gerard Mercator.

2	First humans in Greenland	-3000	-2000	-984.61	-0.61	Little is known about the first people to inhabit Greenland, whose survival at the margins of habitability is both awe-inspiring and reflective of human’s capacity to overcome adversity. Genetic evidence suggests that the ancestors of these early Greenlanders came across Canada from Siberia, reaching Greenland over four thousand years ago. The oldest work of art that has been traced back to Arctic inhabitants is a 3700-year old small, ivory maskette. Sculptures like this were often tiny so that they could be carried from place to place by their nomadic owners. This maskette was discovered on Devon Island in the Arctic Archipelago, a mosaic of islands between mainland Canada and Greenland that would have been traversed by early Arctic pioneers. Over the next several thousand years, at least six distinct cultures migrated to and settled in Greenland. 	Recent evidence suggests that the ancestors of these early Greenlanders came across Canada from Siberia, reaching Greenland over four thousand years ago.
2	Sea level Stabilization	-5000	-4000	-1253.07	-0.78	After the Last Glacial Maximum, gradual warming of the climate and thawing of ice over land opened up migratory routes that facilitated prehistoric human settlement on new continents. At the dawn of our current interglacial period, ice levels reached a new equilibrium. As melting slowed, sea levels stabilized, as did the coastlines that human society has relied on since the beginning of advanced civilization.	Gradual warming of the climate and thawing of ice over land opened up migratory routes that facilitated prehistoric human settlement on new continents.
0	Younger Dryas	-12500	-9500	-1702	-1.06	During Earth’s slow transition from the Last Glacial Period to today’s warmer interglacial, there was an unexpected departure known as the Younger Dryas. Northern Hemispheric temperatures became much cooler, then slowly began to rise again. The end of the Younger Dryas is marked by a local warming of 10º C in just 10 years, which was recorded by oxygen isotopes in Greenland ice GISP2. A hotly contested subject, some researchers believe that the Younger Dryas was caused by a meteor impact and have identified rare metal anomalies in Greenland ice cores as evidence, while others believe that it was due to a brief slowdown of the Atlantic thermohaline cycle caused by a pulse of glacial freshwater.

0	Last Glacial Maximum	-20000	-18000	-1961	-1.22	For the past 2.6 million years, Earth has regularly cycled between glacial and interglacial periods. Modern climate change is categorically different from Earth’s glacial cycles, which are driven by slow, predictable variations in Earth’s orbit, especially when continental land areas are in the polar regions. The peak of the last glacial period occurred 22,000 years ago and was characterized by massive ice sheets covering most of Canada and Northern Europe.

0	Last Interglacial	-130000	-120000	1	1	In earth science, ice ages can last for millions of years with alternating glacial and interglacial periods. The most recent interglacial (not including the present) ended 120 thousand years ago. It is believed that Earth was about 2ºC warmer on average than today’s climate, but unlike modern global warming, the tropics stayed relatively cool due to weak oceanic circulation.

0	Oldest Greenland ice	-1000000	-800000	1	1	Three million years ago, atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) levels plummeted, coinciding with around 3˚C of global cooling. The decrease of atmospheric CO2 – from around 400 parts per million (ppm) to 200 ppm – is of the same magnitude as the change from preindustrial to modern times, but it occurred over hundreds of thousands of years. This reduction in CO2 and temperature resulted in the formation of a vast ice sheet covering Greenland and adjacent Canada, which had been mainly ice-free for 30 million years. Today, the oldest ice that has been extracted from the Greenland ice sheet is more than one million years old.	Three million years ago, atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) levels plummeted, coinciding with around 3˚C of global cooling. This resulted in the formation of a vast ice sheet covering Greenland, which had been mainly ice-free for 30 million years.
